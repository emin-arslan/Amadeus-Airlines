# Amadeus-Airlines

This project was the outcome of a requested assignment during a job interview. Upon completion, I am excited to share it. The design, inspired by Turkish Airlines, has been carefully crafted. Additionally, the project includes test entries with the following details:

- **Departure airport:** Istanbul
- **Arrival airport:** New York
- **Departure date:** 02.02.2024
- **Arrival date:** 03.02.2024

Note that these trial inputs will be invalid starting from 03.02.2024. It's important to mention that due to retrieving data from a non-dynamic JSON file using Mock Service Worker (MSW), entries may not function beyond this date.
